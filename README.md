A closed source and open source application created by me, the open source version needs the "click" and "psutil" libraries and python "3.9.10" and the executable ".exe" file needs nothing. There will be constant updates and read the terms before using the applications.

-{
This program is free to use, so you can use it for commercial, personal or other uses, but its SALE AND HACKING USE IS PROHIBITED and if you agree with these conditions write (y) and if you don't (n).
